# Basic-Calcultaor
Its a basic calculator to print out 4 outputs at the same time my first project

First I used prompt npm and tried to get two numbers as input from users

Then I tried try and catch statements, to get errors if some errors occurs if not then my code will push results

I hope everyone knows if and else loops, but imma give a little intro its like "if(this){then this}" and else is like 2nd case which means (if =! this) or if is false 

In else I created 4 main functions of my program, I had to use ParseFloat to print in number form or my code will print in string and wont even add those numbers.

now call the function

Guide me by your experience, how I can make it better. imma make it scientific calculator someday not today. OwO
